    "1.  What is an API? \n",
    "   \n",
    "    An API (Application Programming Interface) broadly speaking, is a collection of \n",
    "    functions that  usually other programs use to interact with your program.\n",
    "    As such indented users, normally are shielded from *implementation* of the \n",
    "    particulars of the code are just exposed to what is important. \n",
    "1. What is a Web API.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Similar in nature, a web api, is a collection of *endpoints* that users can contact to initiate a remote procedure. \n",
    "    Usually that remote procedure returns a kind of result, typically in a form of a string.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For 90% of the cases, that string contains the information that we are interested about and \n",
    "    and is structured that could be parsed as JSON. e.g. :\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    '{  \n",
    "       \"id\" : 1,   \n",
    "       \"data\": {\"name\": \"Nikos\", \"age\": 35, \"gender\": \"male\", \"height\": 178}       \n",
    "    }'\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   When that string is parsable as JSON, it's called *json string*\n",
    "1. What is a JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "    JSON are initials, meaning  **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    It is a lightweight data structure format, and primerly aimed to be used with JavaScript, \n",
    "    the main language web browesers use. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Python has it's own json parsing library to parse and create json strings. \n",
    "    It's parsing the json's to a python dictionary. For example for the above json string:    "
